# Installation

To install Prometheus, simply clone the Github Repository using:

```batch
git clone "https://github.com/levno-710/Prometheus.git"
```

Alternatively you can download the Sources [here](https://github.com/levno-710/Prometheus/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

Prometheus also Requires LuaJIT or Lua51 in order to work. The Lua51 binaries can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.1.5/Tools%20Executables/).

There is also a bundled release for windows, which includes the luajit runtime. This may be usefull for adding prometheus to %PATH% and then directly using it as a command. It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/levno-710/prometheus/releases).
